Goodbye Python. Goodbye Java.
Adios array bounds checking and godspeed
 garbage collector: I'll miss you both.
Auf wiedersehen exceptions.
So long objects and OO-programming, whatever you are.

Adieu polymorphic types with type inference, higher-order functions,
 rich built-in data, full-on modules, interactive loop,
 time-travelling debugger, byte- and native-code compilers.
Au revoir, OCaml: se la vie.

Now it's time to bang on Bits, 8 of which is a Byte.
Now it's time to point pointers past proper positions,
 to shift, and, or, xor, and more.
Now it's time to malloc() myself and free() freely,
 to deref dangerously which will suffer segfaults and lead to leaks.
Now it's time to code close to the metal and resonate with the machine.

It won't be easy. It may not be fun. But it will be true.
And I will stay determined and see this course through.

Hello C.
