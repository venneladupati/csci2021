  - DO NOT CHANGE any parts of this file except the QUIZ sections as it
    may interfere with the tests otherwise.
  - If your `QUESTIONS.txt' file seems corrupted, restore it by copying
    over the `QUESTIONS.txt.bak' backup file.
  - When you complete the exercises, check your answers with `make test'
    and if all is well, create a zip file with `make zip' and upload it

CODE: 'struct_stride.c' Program
===============================

  The provided 'struct_stride.c' program has a number of TODO items in
  it related to timing several computations and reporting their results.
  It is best to complete these items first and then attempt to answer
  the quiz questions as some questions require running the program and
  observing timing results.

  Use the lab's description of how the 'clock_gettime()' function works to
  complete TODO items and print the results.

  When completed, the program can be run as show below:
  ,----
  | >> ./struct_stride
  | usage: ./struct_stride <arr_length> <num_iters>
  |
  | >> ./struct_stride 10000000 100
  | method: int_field_base CPU time: 1.2345e-01 sec   sum: 0
  | method: arr_field_base CPU time: 1.2345e-01 sec   sum: 0
  | method: int_field_optm CPU time: 1.2345e-01 sec   sum: 0
  | method: arr_field_optm CPU time: 1.2345e-01 sec   sum: 0
  `----

  NOTE: the timing information has intentionally been changed to read
  1.2345e-01 as calculating this timing information is part of the lab.


QUIZ: Timing 'struct_stride.c' Runs
===================================

Relative Speed of Struct Layouts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  After adding in calls to 'clock_gettime()' and code to print times, run the
  `struct_stride' program.

  Run the program with a large array and a modest amount of array
  iterations such as using the following parameters:
  ,----
  | ./struct_stride 10000000 100
  `----

  Examine the times reported.

  Which option below reflects the relative speeds of the
  layout/algorithm combinations?
    ------SLOWEST--------------------------------------------FASTEST-----
  - ( ) arr_field_base > arr_field_optm > int_field_base > int_field_optm
  - ( ) int_field_base > int_field_optm > arr_field_base > arr_field_optm
  - ( ) arr_field_base > int_field_base > arr_field_optm > int_field_optm
  - (X) int_field_base > arr_field_base > int_field_optm > arr_field_optm


int_field_base VS arr_field_base
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  Examine the differences between the two types of structs that are used
  in 'struct_stride.c' called 'int_field_t' and 'arr_field_t'.

  Now examine the first two code blocks that use these structs, called
  'int_field_base' and 'arr_field_base'. Both involve arrays and structs
  which store an equal number of positive and negative
  integers. However, they differ in the overall layout of those
  integers.  Both use loops to sum the "a" numbers first, then sum the "b"
  numbers, and finally combine them for the total sum.

  Which of the following is a possible explanation for the timing
  difference between `int_field_base' and `arr_field_base'?
  - ( ) `int_field_base' must perform more loop iterations than
    `arr_field_base' which will making it slower.
  - ( ) `arr_field_base' uses more memory to store its numbers than
    `int_field_base' and this additional memory increases speed.
  - (X) `int_field_base' has a memory layout that is ABABABAB so when
    adding A elements, there is a "stride" through
    memory. `arr_field_base' has a layout like `AAAAABBBBB' so adding
    elements has no stride.
  - ( ) `int_field_base' uses struct field access. The assembly
    instructions to access struct fields are slower than the assembly
    instructions that access array elements. This makes `arr_field_base'
    faster due to its use of plain integer arrays.


BASE vs OPTM versions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  The last two layout/algorithm sections are labeled "optm" as they
  perform a simple code transformation from their "base" version.

  Select ALL of the items below that are accomplished with this
  transformation.

  - (X) Fewer loop checks/increments are needed as there is only one
    loop instead of two.
  - ( ) The number of loop iterations is lowered for all loops in the
    optm version.
  - (X) The memory stride is eliminated for the int_field_optm as both
    a/b elements are added each iteration.
  - ( ) The algorithmic complexity is reduced from O(N^2) in the "base"
    to O(N) in the "optm" version.

QUIZ: Linked List Analysis
==========================

  Study the code in the linked list files, particularly 'list_funcs.c'.o

  What is true about the implementation of the 'list_find' function?
  - ( ) It is incorrect as it will not return the correct location of an element in all possible cases.
  - ( ) It does a single traversal of the linked list elements.
  - (X) It calls 'list_get()' each time it reaches a new position in the list.
  - ( ) It is both correct and will have the best possible performance.

  What is the asymptotic complexity of the 'list_find' function?
  Reminder: Here 'n' is the number of elements in the linked list.
  - ( ) O(n)
  - (X) O(n^2)
  - ( ) O(n^3)
  - ( ) O(n * log(n))

CODE: Improving the Linked List
===============================

  Start by studying the code in the 'list_main.c' file. This program tests out
  the execution speed of different search scenarios by creating a data structure
  (either a linked list or an array) of a specified size and then repeatedly
  searching that data structure.

  Complete the 'TODO' items in the 'list_main.c" file. Specifically, you will
  need to add code to record start and end timestamps. You should be able to
  reuse similar code from the 'struct_stride' program.

  Next, observe the performance of the provided 'list_find' function using
  the 'list_main' program. This program takes in two command-line arguments:
    1. The search algorithm to use (here, 'list_find')
    2. The size of the linked list to search

  For example, to test out 'list_find' on a linked list of 1000 elements:
  ,-------
  | > make list_main
  | > ./list_main list_find 1000
  `-------

  Write your own version of a linked list search by completing the
  "list_find_student" function within the "list_funcs_student.c" file. You
  should design this code so that it runs significantly faster than the
  search algorithm we provided to you.

  To pass the test for this part of the lab, your code not only needs to
  produce the correct result, it also needs be fast enough to complete before
  the timeout expires (the list search code given to you will not be able to do
  this).

  To test out your code, use 'list_find_student' as the first command-line
  argument to the 'list_main' program. For example:
  ,-----
  | > make list_main
  | > ./list_main list_find_student 1000
  `-----

QUIZ: Observing Array Performance
=================================

  Next, observe how searching an array performs compared to searching a linked
  list. Use 'array_find' as the first command-line argument to 'list_main' to
  perform a search of an array of the specified size.

  For example, to test out a search of an array of 50000 elements:
  ,-----
  | > ./list_main array_find 50000
  `-----

  Make sure to use a large enough size so that you can observe a reliable
  pattern in your results.

  When searching *the same* number of total elements, what are the relative
  execution speeds of the three implementations featured in this lab?
  SLOWEST <--------------------------------> FASTEST
  - ( ) array_find > list_find_student > list_find
  - ( ) list_find > array_find > list_find_student
  - (X) list_find > list_find_student > array_find
  - ( ) The execution speeds are all roughly the same

  What accounts for difference in execution speed of 'list_find_student' vs
  the 'array_find' scenario?
  - ( ) Searching the linked list is O(n^2) while searching the array is O(n).
  - ( ) Searching the array is O(n^2) while searching the linked list is O(n).
  - ( ) Linked list elements are contiguous in memory while array elements are
        scattered across different locations.
  - (X) Array elements are contiguous in memory while linked list elements are
        scattered across different locations.
